The Midnight in Me Lyrics

[Sci-Twi]
It used to be so simple
It was a world I understood
I didn't know what I didn't know
And life seemed pretty good
But now the darkness rises
From somewhere deep inside of me
Her power all but takes me
Can I keep this midnight from getting free?
If I can stay in the light
I know I'll be free
Then I can start to be whole
I can start to be me
But instead I am struggling
With all that I see
And these friends
Mustn't see the midnight in me
The midnight in me-ee
They mustn't see the midnight in
Meeeee
