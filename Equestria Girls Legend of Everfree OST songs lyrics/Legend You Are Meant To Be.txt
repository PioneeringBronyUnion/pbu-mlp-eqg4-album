Legend You Are Meant To Be Lyrics

[Sci-Twi]
I used to think that stories were just that
Set in stone, concrete as a fact
It didn't dawn on me
That I could change history

[Sunset Shimmer]
Now I know I'm writing my own song
Fight my way to the ending that I want
I'll turn a tragedy
Into a epic fantasy

[All]
Hey! Hey! Hey!
You can be a hero (hero) too
Oh-oh-oh
Take my hand, I'm here for you
Come away with me
Be the legend you are meant to be
You'll always be
Everfree
Oh, oo-wah, ah-oh, oo-wah, ah-oh, oo-wah
To be the legend you are meant to be
Oh, oo-wah, ah-oh, oo-wah, ah-oh, oo-wah
To be the legend you are meant to be

[Fluttershy]
There was a time when fear would hold me down
Cause I let it chain me to the ground

[Rainbow Dash]
Look at me now, I'm soaring high
It's never boring in the sky

[Applejack]
When I know I've got friends on my side
Whatever trials I'll take them all in stride

[Rarity]
Together we will shine so bright
Radiant brilliance in the night

[All]
Hey! Hey! Hey!
You can be a hero (hero) too
Oh-oh-oh
Take my hand, I'm here for you
Come away with me
Be the legend you are meant to be
You'll always be
Everfree
Oh, oo-wah, ah-oh, oo-wah, ah-oh, oo-wah
To be the legend you are meant to be
Oh, oo-wah, ah-oh, oo-wah, ah-oh, oo-wah
To be the legend you are meant to be!
