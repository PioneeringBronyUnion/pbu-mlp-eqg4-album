Gather close in my protection

Behold the beauty of nature in all its glory

No need to fear the vultures at the door

Right here you have me to protect you

Within these walls of thorns
于荆之壁怒吼

For Everfree forevermore!
为森灵地 永不沦落

They have come into our domain

Here to seal our camp in chains
铁链之下吾土危

But we have held it for generations

This is just a complication
混乱只不过是须臾之时

We will stand for Everfree!
定 要 保卫这营地！
Trust in me, this is for your own good
相信我 一切不会辜负

Don't be afraid

All of this beauty that surrounds us
围绕我们不止美丽繁华

Every lovely bloom designed to defend
花朵的美丽 是自卫的伪装
 
Let them come! Just let them try!
来啊 放马都过来！

I'm not about to say goodbye!
才不会轻易退下来！

This camp will be here throughout the ages
营地会于此永驻万世

Written into the history pages
被世界纪录于广阔历史

We will stand for Everfree!
定 要 保卫这营地！
