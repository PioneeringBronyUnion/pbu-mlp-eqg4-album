It used to be so simple

It was a world I understood

I didn't know what I didn't know
我不知本不知

And life seemed pretty good
事物都美好

But now the darkness rises
但现在黑恶涌起

From somewhere deep inside of me
就在我 内心的深处

Her power all but takes me
她的力量吞噬我

Can I keep this midnight from getting free?
我能否 将这恶魔封印

If I can stay in the light
如我能沐浴光明

I know I'll be free
我知将自由

Then I can start to be whole
我就能重完整

I can start to be me
就能成自己

But instead I am struggling
但其实我在苦斗

With all that I see
这些我所见

And these friends
让朋友们

Mustn't see the midnight in me
定不见那黑暗的我

The midnight in me-ee
那黑暗的我

They mustn't see the midnight in
定不会见那黑暗的

Meeeee
我
